  "detail_descrip_1": "This project is a full redesign and rebuild of a previous website I developed for CF Dans during my first semester as a student. The client needed a modern and more intuitive site to better present their weekly outdoor dance sessions, event-based offers and prices. I handled the entire process from concept and design to development and deployment. The site is production-ready, but currently awaits updated media assets from the client. Once these are in place, I plan to further improve the site’s SEO, perform a full accessibility check and add animations.",
  "detail_descrip_2": "The site is built with Astro, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Since the project consists of a small number of static pages and relatively simple content, Astro was an ideal choice. I’ve focused on keeping the codebase clean and simple with a minimal file structure to ensure maintainability in the future.",
