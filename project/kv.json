We were lucky to be able to work together with Kattens Værn to give them our take on a redesigned new website that would better relate to the younger part of their target group.",
  "detail_descrip_2": "We built a modern frontend to display and handle all their data with Next.js and set up a WordPress site to function as their database/content management system. Everything on the site comes from Wordpress, (except for some content) the cats for adoption, articles, different shelters all come from dynamic data that can be edited, removed or added to from the wordpress site. The missing and found cat forms also post to the database and triggers a build hook so the new cat will be displayed on the lists shortly after.",
